# `libm`

A port of [MUSL]'s libm to Rust.

> [!NOTE]

## Goals

The short term goal of this library is to [enable math support (e.g. `sin`, `atan2`) for the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target][wasm] (cf. [rust-lang/compiler-builtins][pr]). The longer
term goal is to enable [math support in the `core` crate][core].
